Portuguese Text Generation with Artificial Neural Networks

<img src = "MachadoAssisBot.png">

- Project developed by Marcelo Rovai, based on lessons learned with the great teacher [Jos√© Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-tensorflow-2-and-keras-deep-learning-bootcamp/#instructor-1) during his fantastic course: [Complete Tensorflow 2 and Keras Deep Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-tensorflow-2-and-keras-deep-learning-bootcamp/#instructor-1)
- The Artificial network developed on this project, generates text, character by character. Please see this following site, for a great general visual explanation: [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and also check the [TF site for details](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/text/text_generation.ipynb).
